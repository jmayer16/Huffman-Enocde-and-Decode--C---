The program goes about decoding in the general way by asking for the two files then decoding the bitstream file by building the tree from the header and then writing the message in the text file. I chose to make the tree being built a character tree and made use of the position class and recursion to both build it and write the message. I know I could have just made the tree an int tree, but it was better for my thought process to make it a character tree. I attempted the extra credit but couldn't get it to throw the errors very well so I removed all of that implementation from the code. It was a fun assignment.
